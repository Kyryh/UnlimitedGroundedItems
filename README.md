# UnlimitedGroundedItems
Terraria mod that increases the cap for items on the ground

## How to use
Simply install the mod. Doing so should more than double your grounded items cap.
If you want to increase it even further do so in the mod's config.
You can put a value in the range 0-10000 (anything higher and your pc would explode trust me).
